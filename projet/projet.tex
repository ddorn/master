    \subsection{The parity game}
    \begin{definition}
        The \emph{parity game} is an inifinite two player game
        played on a directed graph $G = (V, E)$. Let $V_0, V_1$
        be a partition of the vertices of $G$, and $p: V \to \N$
        any function, called the \emph{priority function}.
        Let also $v_0 \in V$ be the strating point of the game.

        The game goes as follows: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It starts at $v_0$
            \item At a given turn $i$, if $v_i \in V_0$,
                player 0 decides to move to an adjacent node 
                $v_{i+1}$. Otherwise if $v_i \in V_1$, it is 
                player 1 that picks a neighbourg.
            \item After $\w$ turns, they produce a sequence of vertices 
                $(v_n)_{n \in \N} \in V$. Let $V^\infty$ be the set of
                vertices that have been visited infinitely many times.
                If $\max \setst{p(v)}{v \in V^\infty}$ is even, player 0 
                wins. If it is odd, player 1 wins.
        \end{itemize}

    \end{definition}

    \[  
        W = \setst{b \in T}{
            \exists z \in V ~ \forall z' \in V \left(
                \begin{array}{c}
                    p(z) \even
                    \\ \wedge \\
                    \existsinf i,~ v_i = z
                    \\ \wedge \\
                    p(z') > p(z) \implies \exists N \forall n > N v_n \neq z'
                \end{array}
            \right)
        }
