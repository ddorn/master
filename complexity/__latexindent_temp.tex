    \section*{Exercise 1}
    Using Savtich's theorem, it suffices to show that 
    $\klotski \in \NPSPACE$. 

    An non deterministic algorithm that solves \klotski
    in polynomial space is the following (in Python notation):

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
        def klotski(board):
            for i in range(2 ** board.size):
                if red_piece_on_exit(board): 
                    return True
            
                guess next_move
                apply(next_move, board)
            return False
    \end{lstlisting}

    Where \texttt{guess} chooses a move randomly and \texttt{apply}
    modifies the board according to the chosen move. It is clear that
    \texttt{apply} can be implemented to use a space polynomial
    in the size of the board configuration and similarly for 
    \texttt{red\_piece\_on\_exit}.
    Thus, this algorithm operate with polynomial space.

    This algorithm always terminates with the right answer since
    if a board can be solved, it can be solved without going twice 
    through the same configuration, and thus all boards can be solved 
    in less than $2^n$ moves, where $n$ is the length of the input, 
    assuming that for all board configuration on a given square
    their description have the same length $n$.

    \section*{Exercice 2}

    We first show that \UniqueSAT is $\coNP$-hard.
    To that extent, we reduce \UnSAT to it.

    Let $\p$ be a DNF formula which is an input of \UnSAT,
    we construct a $\p'$ that has a unique solution if and only if 
    $\p$ is unsatisfiable. 
    Let $(C_i)_{i < m}$ be the $m$ clauses of $\p$,
    Let $x_1, \dots, x_n$ be the variables
    appearing in $\p$ and $z$ be a
