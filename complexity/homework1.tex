    \section*{Exercise 1}

    For a decisive Turing machine $\Mm$, we write $L(\Mm)$ for the language it decides.
    We first show that if $L(\Mm) \in \NP$, then $L(\Mm) \in \coNP$.

    \begin{claim}
        If 
        $L(\Mm) \in \NP$ 
        for all decisive Turing machine $\Mm$, 
        then for all decisive Turing machine $\Nn$,
        $L(\Nn) \in \coNP$.
    \end{claim}

    \begin{proof}
        Let $\Mm$ be a decisive Turing machine,
        we build a decisive Turing machine $\compl{\Mm}$
        that runs exactly the same way as $\Mm$, but on each branch,
        when it halts it outputs \textit{yes} when $\Mm$ outputs \textit{no}
        and \textit{no} when $\Mm$ outputs \textit{yes}. The \textit{maybe} 
        do not change. This way $\compl{\Mm}$ accepts a word $x$ if and only
        if $\Mm$ does not accept $x$. 
        Thus $L(\compl{\Mm}) = \compl{L(\Mm)}$.
        Using the hypothesis with $\compl{\Mm}$, 
        we get that $L(\compl{\Mm}) = \compl{L(\Mm)} \in \NP$
        and therefore $L(\Mm) \in \coNP$.
    \end{proof}

    We now prove that for a polytime decisive Turing machine $\Mm$, 
    $L(\Mm) \in \NP$.
    To that extent, we construct a polytime verifier $V(x, C)$ for $L$
    as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $C$ doesn't encode a sequence of transitions of $\Mm$, reject $x$. 
            Otherwise, let $(C_n)$ be the finite sequence of transitions encoded by $C$.
        \item Simulate $\Mm$ on input $x$ and on the $n$-th step, use $C_n$ to decide 
            of the next state of the deterministic simulation. 
            If the transition $C_n$ is not in the transition function of $\Mm$, reject $x$.
        \item When the simulation of $\Mm$ halts, if it outputs $yes$, 
            accept $x$. Otherwise, reject $x$.
    \end{itemize}

    Since we can simulate Turing machines with only a polynomial slowdown,
    and $\Mm$ is a polytime NTM, 
    it is clear that $V$ run in polynomial time.
    Thus, we only need to prove that $\Mm$ accepts $x$ if and only if there exist $C$
    such that $V(x, C)$ accepts $x$. 

    First, we notice that on any given input $x$, there cannot be one branch 
    of the computation that outputs \textit{yes} and an other one that outputs \textit{no}.
    
    For the first direction, there is a branch of the computation of 
    $\Mm$ on input $x$ that halts on a \textit{yes} or $\textit{no}$,
    so it suffices to take $C$ as the sequence of transitions
    that make up that branch.

    For the reverse direction, if there is a $C$ that make $V$ output \textit{yes},
    it must be a valid sequence of transitions for $\Mm$, 
    and when $\Mm$ follows this branch, it outputs \textit{yes}.
    Since there is a branch of $\Mm$ that outputs \textit{yes},
    all the other branches must outputs \textit{yes} or \textit{maybe}
    and thus $\Mm$ accepts $x$.


    \section*{Exercice 2}

    First we show that \textsc{SepMatch} is in $\NP$.
    We can define a verifier $V(G, k, C)$ 
    for \textsc{SepMatch} with the certificate $C$ being
    an encoding of the edges of the matching.
    $V$ checks for all pair of edges if the distance
    between each pair of points is less than 2 in $G$, 
    and that there are exactly $k$ edges. This can be done
    in $\O{|G|^3}$.

    To show that \textsc{SepMatch} is $\NP$-hard,
    we reduce \textsc{IndSet} to it.

    Let $G = (V, E)$ be any finite graph. We define the graph $G' = (V', E')$
    as \begin{itemize}
        \item $V' = V \times \set{0, 1}$
        \item $E' = \setst{
            \bigparenthesis{(u, i), (v, j)} \in V' \times V'
        }{
            (u, v) \in V \vee (u = v \wedge j = 1 - i)
        }$, that is, two vertices are connected in $G'$
        if their first coordinate are connected in $G$
        or if they their first coordinate is the same and the second coordinate
        are different.
    \end{itemize}

    Our reduction from \textsc{IndSet} to \textsc{SepMatch}
    if the function that maps and input of \textsc{IndSet}
    $\angles{G, k}$ to the input of \textsc{SepMatch} $\angles{G', k}$.

    Before proving that this is indeed a reduction, we notice that this map 
    is computable in polynomial time and we setup some notations and a lemma.
    Let $d_G$ and $d_{G'}$ the distances between vertices of $G$ and $G'$
    respectively. For a node $u \in G'$, we write $u = (u_0, u_1)$,
    and $\pi_0$ the projection on the first coordinate, so $\pi_0(u) = u_0$.

    \begin{lemma*}
        For all $u, v \in V'$ with $u_0 \neq v_0$, \[
            d_{G'}(u, v) = d_G(u_0, v_0).
        \]
    \end{lemma*}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $u, v \in V'$. We first show that $d_{G'}(u, v) \geq d_G(u_0, v_0)$.
        Indeed, let $\w = \w_0\w_1\dots\w_n$ be a path from $u$ to $v$ in $G'$. 
        We have that $\w_G = \pi_0(\w_0) \pi_0(\w_1) \dots \pi_0(\w_n)$
        is a path in $G$ if we remove vertices that may appear more than once consecutively.
        Thus $\abs{\w_G} \leq \abs{\w}$ and the distances in $G$ are always 
        less than the distances in $G'$.

        It remains to be shown that $d_{G'}(u, v) \leq d_G(u_0, v_0)$.
        Let $\w = w_0\w_1\dots\w_n$  be a path from $u_0$ to $v_0$ in $G$. We
        construct a path $\w_{G'}$ from $u$ to $v$ of the same length 
        in $G'$. For $i = 0, \dots, n$,
        \[ 
            (\w_{G'})_i = \begin{cases}
                (\w_0, u_1) & \tif i = 0 \\
                (\w_i, v_1) & \tif i > 0
            \end{cases}
        \]
        This is clearly a path in $G'$ from $(\w_0, u_1) = u$ to $(\w_n, v_1) = v$
        since at any step $\w_i$ is a neighbour of $\w_{i+1}$.
        Thus distances in $G'$ are at most distances in $G$.
    \end{proof}

    We now show that $\angles{G, k} \in \textsc{IndSet}$ if and only if 
    $\angles{G', k} \in \textsc{SepMatch}$.
    
    \paragraph{$\implies$}
    Let $S \subset V$ be an independent set of size $k$,
    then $M = \setst{
        \bigparenthesis{
            (s, 0), (s, 1)
        }}{
            s \in S
        }
    $ is a separated matching (of size $k$) in $G'$.
    Indeed, let $e, e' \in M$ be two different edges.
    We know that for all $u \in e$ and $v \in e'$, 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $u_0 \neq v_0$ since the edges are different.
        \item $d_G(u_0, v_0) \geq 2$ since $S$ is an independent set.
    \end{itemize}
    So by the lemma, $d_{G'}(u, v) = d_G(u_0, v_0) \geq 2$
    and $M$ is indeed a separated matching.

    \paragraph{$\impliedby$}
    If $\angles{G', k} \in \textsc{SepMatch}$, 
    let $M$ be a separated matching of size $k$. 
    We show that 
    \[
        S = \setst{u_0}{(u, v) \in M}
    \]  
    is an independent set (of size $k$) in $G$.
    To that extent, let $u_0, u_0' \in S$
    and $(u, v), (u', v') \in M$ the corresponding edges.
    Since $M$ is a separated matching, 
    we have that $d_{G'}(u, u') \geq 2$
    so that, by the lemma, $d_G(u_0, u_0') = d_{G'}(u, u') \geq 2$,
    so $u_0$ and $u_0'$ are indeed separated.


    \section*{Exercice 3}

    \paragraph{1.}
    Let \Uu be a universal Turing machine that can
    simulate an other Turing machine with a polynomial slowdown.
    We set $A$ as the same oracle as in class, that is, 
    \[
        A = \setst{ \angles{M, 1^k} }{
            \Uu\parenthesis{
                \angles{M, \angles{M, 1^k}}
            } = 0
            \text{ in } 2^k \text{ steps}
        }.
    \]
    We have seen in class that $\Ptime^A = \NP^A$, so we just show that
    $\coNP^A = \NP^A$. Indeed, 
    \begin{align*}
        L \in \coNP^A 
        &\iff 
        \compl{L} \in \NP^A
        \\& \iff 
        \compl{L} \in \Ptime^A
        \\& \iff 
        L \in \coP^A = \NP^A.
    \end{align*}
    Were the last line follows from the fact that if a language can be 
    decided deterministically in polynomial time, then its complement
    can be too, by just inverting the outputs of the Turing machine.

    \paragraph{2.}
    Let $ \Bb = \left\{ B : \forall n \abs{B \cap \set{0, 1}^n} = 1 \right\} $,
    and for $B \in \Bb$, let $
        L_B = \setst{1^n}{ \exists x \in \set{0, 1}^{n-1}, 0x \in B}
    $.

    \begin{claim}
        For all $B \in \Bb$, $L_B \in \NP$.
    \end{claim}
    \begin{proof}
        If $1^n \in L_B$, a certificate is the $x \in \set{0, 1}^{n-1}$
        such that $0x \in B$. Indeed, a verifier can check if $0x \in B$ in a 
        single query to the oracle.
    \end{proof}


    \begin{claim}
        For all $B \in \Bb$, $L_B \in \coNP$.
    \end{claim}
    \begin{proof}
        We have that \begin{align*}
            \compl{L_B} &=
            \setst{1^n}{ 
                \forall x \in \set{0, 1}^{n-1}, 0x \notin B
            }
            \\&=
            \setst{1^n}{ 
                \exists x \in \set{0, 1}^{n-1}, 1x \in B
            }
        \end{align*}
        where the last equality follows from the the fact that
        $\abs{B \cap \set{0, 1}^n} = 1$.
        With $\compl{L_B}$ written as such, we can apply the same proof as the previous
        claim, mutatis mutandis.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{claim}
        There exist $B \in \Bb$ such that $L_B \notin \Ptime^B$.
    \end{claim}
    \begin{proof}
        Fix an enumeration $(M_n)_{n \in \N}$ of all oracle compatible Turing machines,
        and let $b: \N \to \N \times \N$ be any bijection.
        We define the sequence $\Mm_n = M_{b(n)_0}$ that contains each Turing machine
        infinitely many times.

        We now construct $B$ so that it fools each machine $M_n$ that runs in
        polynomial time.
        Fix $n \in N$, we now construct the $x \in \set{0, 1}^n$
        that belongs to $B$.
        We run $\Mm_n$ on $1^n$, and let $Q_k$ be the set of queries 
        that $\Mm_n$ has asked up to the $k$-th
        step of execution (not included).
        For $i \in \set{0,1}$, we define $Q_k^i = \setst{q \in Q_k^i}{\abs{q} = n \andd q_0 = i}$
        the set of queries of length $n$ that start with a $i$.
        At step $k$, if the machine queries ``$q \in B$?'':
        \begin{itemize}
            \item if $q \notin \set{0, 1}^n$, we can \textit{yes} if and only 
                if $q = 0^{\abs{q}}$, which would not change the output of 
                a $\Mm_n$ on input $x$ that recognises any fixed $B$.
            \item if $q \in Q_k$, the query has been already made, so 
                we answer the same as the previous time the machine made this query.
            \item if $q \notin Q_k$ and for some $i \in \set{0, 1}$, $\abs{Q_k^i} = 2^n$, 
                that is, the set $i\concat \set{0, 1}^{n-1}$
                was completely queried before, we must have $q \in (1-i)\concat \set{0, 1}^{n-1}$
                so we say say that $q \notin B$.
            \item otherwise, if $\abs{Q_k^{q_0}} = 2^n -1$, that is, 
                $q$ is the last non-queried entry that start with $q_0$,
                we say that $q \in B$
            \item otherwise we say that $q \notin B$.
        \end{itemize}

        When the machine halts, if it hasn't queried all of both
        $i \concat \set{0, 1}^{n}$, for $i = 0, 1$,
        if the machine outputs: \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{yes},
                let $x \in \setst{1y \in \set{0, 1}^n}{\forall k, 1y \notin Q_k^1}$.
            \item \textit{no},
                let $x \in \setst{0y \in \set{0, 1}^n}{\forall k, 0y \notin Q_k^0}$.
        \end{itemize}
        We set $B \cap \set{0, 1}^{n} = \set{x}$, which is a number that $\Mm_n$
        did not query and that make its prediction fail.

        Thus, with the $B$ as constructed, if a machine $\Mm_n$ doesn't query 
        at least all the sequences in $\set{0, 1}^n$ that start with 0
        or all the sequences that start with 1,
        it fails.
        Therefore we only need to show that every polytime machine $M_N$
        don't query enough the oracle on large inputs.
        Indeed, fix a polytime machine $M_N$
        and define a subsequence
        $(\Mm_{n_k})_{k \in \N} \subset (\Mm_n)_{n \in \N}$ 
        such that for all $k \in \N$, $M_{n_k} = M_N$.
        However, since $n^{\O1} << \O{2^n}$, there must be some $k \in \N$,
        such that $\Mm_{n_k}$ doesn't make $2^{n_k} - 1$ queries and therefore fails.
        Thus, $M_N$ fails on input $1^{n_k}$, and there is no polynomial time
        machine that decides $L_B$.
    \end{proof}

    Therefore, $L_B \in \NP^B \cap \coNP^B \setminus \Ptime^B$.
