# Courses notes of my Master at EPFL

This repository holds some of my notes from the classes I've followed during my
master at EPFL, from automn 2021 to spring 2023.  They are mostly mathematics
and informatics classes.

The notes are all written in LaTeX, so you need a LaTeX compiler in order to
read them in pdf.

For each class, the notes are contained in the corresponding folder, except
for the preamble, which common to all of them and is located in the top-level
folder.
